# npkill
A CLI application built in Python to remove all node modules in a directory. 

## Get started
If you are on windows, I suggest you use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to use linux on windows. 
```
git clone https://github.com/simar-singh/npkill.git
cd npkill
chmod +x npkill
cp npkill /usr/local/bin
```

Then, run npkill in any directory where you would want to remove node_modules from.
